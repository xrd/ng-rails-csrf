# ng-rails-csrf

Using AngularJS and Rails together? If you are making any HTTP requests then the "ng-rails-csrf" gem can help by automatically adding the CSRF token to HTTP headers. Rails will not accept requests without this token if you are using CSRF protection.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'ng-rails-csrf', :git => "git://github.com/xrd/ng-rails-csrf.git"

And then execute:

    $ bundle

In your module definition, include the "ng-rails-csrf" module

    var module = angular.module( 'mySpecialModule', [ 'ngResource', 'ng-rails-csrf' ] ).

Then, add the asset to your application.js. The following line should go *before* any module which uses it and *after* angular is included in your asset list. 

    //= require ng-rails-csrf

See the sample project if you need an example: https://github.com/xrd/ng-rails-csrf-sample (application.js: https://raw.github.com/xrd/ng-rails-csrf-sample/master/app/assets/javascripts/application.js)

Now all HTTP requests (both those made with the raw $http object and those created with $resource) will get the CSRF token properly included in the request headers.
